# FlowTab Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** December 24, 2024  
**Last Updated:** December 24, 2024

## Overview

FlowTab is a privacy-first Chrome extension that replaces your new tab page with a productivity hub. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring complete transparency about our data practices.

## Data Collection

**FlowTab does NOT collect any personal data.**

We do not:
- Collect personal information (names, emails, phone numbers)
- Track your browsing history
- Monitor your web activity
- Send data to external servers
- Use analytics or tracking tools
- Store data in the cloud
- Share information with third parties

## Local Storage Only

FlowTab uses your browser's local storage to save:
- Your to-do list items
- Timer preferences (Pomodoro settings)
- Theme and display preferences
- Language settings
- Welcome screen completion status

**Important:** All data remains on your device and is never transmitted anywhere.

## Permissions Explained

FlowTab requests minimal permissions:

### Storage Permission
- **Purpose:** Save your settings and to-do items locally on your device
- **Scope:** Only local browser storage, no cloud storage
- **Data:** User preferences, to-do items, timer settings

### Tabs Permission
- **Purpose:** Replace the default new tab page with FlowTab
- **Scope:** Only affects new tab behavior
- **Data:** No browsing data is accessed or stored

## Third-Party Services

FlowTab does not integrate with any third-party services, APIs, or external websites. The extension operates entirely offline after installation.

## Data Security

Since all data is stored locally on your device:
- Your data is as secure as your device
- No risk of data breaches from our servers (we don't have any)
- You have complete control over your data
- Uninstalling the extension removes all stored data

## Children's Privacy

FlowTab does not collect any data from users of any age. The extension is safe for users under 13 as no personal information is gathered.

## Your Rights

You have complete control over your data:
- **Access:** View your data in the extension settings
- **Modify:** Edit or delete to-do items and preferences anytime
- **Delete:** Uninstall the extension to remove all data
- **Export:** No export needed as data stays on your device

## Changes to This Policy

If we ever change our privacy practices (which is unlikely given our no-data approach), we will:
- Update this policy
- Notify users through the extension
- Maintain the same privacy-first principles
